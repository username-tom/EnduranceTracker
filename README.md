## How to use

App will ask you to login to Google account for Google API.

The app by default will use my test sheet for data.

To use your own Google sheet:

1. Create a new Google Sheet.
2. Copy the sheet ID from the browser address.
   - e.g. .../spreadsheets/d/**1eT516P2BHNUItpuoz8_aylJNPMPgpFOp2u7DZhhgICo**/...
3. Click Data > Change Spreadsheet on the top left and paste in the ID.
4. The app will copy over a template to your sheet to setup your tracking data.
